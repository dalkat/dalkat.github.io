    caption: My sister Elena and I in Cinque Terre, Italy in October. She was backpacking Europe after graduating college and met up with me on the first leg of my trip. We forgot to pack bathing suits that day, but it didn't stop us from jumping in!

    caption: My cousin George's big fat Jewish wedding in November, complete with a beautiful huppa, broken glass, 'Next year in Jerusalem', and all. This wedding had me emotional for a different reason&colon; I think as we get older we finally appreciate and cherish our cultures and traditions, and it was that week that I realized how important preserving that is for me.

    caption: Over New Years, Joe and I backpacked in Torres del Paine, Patagonia. Pictured here are a million layers to combat fickle weather, incredible views on our uphill trek, and me being grumpy after 25 of our 30+ miles of backpacking. This trip was one of the physically hardest things I've ever done.

    caption: My youngest brother, Ryan, turned 10 this February! We organized our first "Camp Katan" retreat weekend in the Catskills to celebrate! We played board games, made challah and pancakes, roasted smores, went tubing, and more. Most importantly, after the first day, Ryan exclaimed, "This is the most family bonding time we ever had!" and I almost cried.

    caption: Mike, Joe, and I on the one day it his 95 degrees in San Francisco. SF apartments don't have AC... and as we moped around the house Monday morning, throwing ice cubes down our shirts, we realized it was so hot that we wouldn't feel how freezing cold the Pacific was. So there we were, minutes later, swimming by the Golden Gate bridge!

    caption: Nothing brought me more joy than spending time with my little munchkin brother. He came to visit me for a week in SF, and reminded me how to live life like a kid! One of the things we did was go camping on a farm, where we got to heard a flock of geese and feed baby goats! (Do you like animal photos? I WILL SEND THEM!)

    caption: I went on an amazing retreat with my Sandbox community - it was a weekend jampacked with child-like forts in a tree grove under the stars, hikes ending in dance parties on the beach, heart-to-hearts, art and cacao ceremony, and more. Also included me baking over 16 loaves of challah on Friday night for the crew!

    caption: These people are some of the most important in my life. This night felt very much like those times in high school when your best friends could show up at your house unannounced and stay up all night laughing about everything and nothing at the same time. Grateful :)
